Alphabetic Telephone Number Translator

	Many companies use telephone numbers like 555-GET-FOOD so the number is easier for their customers to remember.  On a standard telephone, the alphabetic letters are mapped to numbers in the following fashion:

	A, B, and C = 2
	D, E, and F = 3
	G, H, and I = 4
	J, K, and L = 5
	M, N, and O = 6
	P, Q, R, and S = 7
	T, U, and V = 8
	W, X, Y, and Z = 9

	Write a program that asks the user to enter a 10-character telephone number in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX (where X can be a letter or a number).  The program should display the telephone number with any alphabetic characters that appeared in the original translated to their numeric equivalent.  For example, if the user enters 555-get-GOOD the application should display 555-438-3663.

	Your program should have good internal documentation, use methods and be user friendly.  Make sure that when the user runs the program, they understand how to enter the telephone number – be extremely user friendly.
