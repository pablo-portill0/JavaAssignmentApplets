Mulch


As I was doing my Mulch this past summer, I realized I keep changing the size of my rectangular flower bed and need to recalculate how much mulch I will have to order.  Each year, I’m either changing the length or the width (larger or smaller).  So, what I need you to is create a class that I can use when next summer rolls around.

Once I know the length and width, I want to use the program to calculate the following:

	•	The perimeter of the flower bed, so I know how much wood to buy to put around it.
	•	The volume of the flower bed (use a height of 3 inches)
	•	How many bags of mulch I need to buy.  

Length and width should be measured in inches.  The bags of mulch that I buy are two cubic feet each.  One cubic foot is equivalent to 12 x 12 x 12 cubic inches = 1728 cubic inches.

Here’s what you will need for the Mulch class.

	Fields:  
	•	length
	•	width
	Methods: 
	•	setLength(double)
	•	getLength() double
	•	setWidth(double)
	•	getWidth() double
	•	getPerim() double
	•	getVol() double
	•	getNumBags() double
     

Once you have completed writing your Mulch class, also write a program that will demo all of your methods to show that they work.  


Input and output should be done with Dialog and Message boxes. Your program should be well documented internally and externally.
