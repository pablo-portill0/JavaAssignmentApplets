Mulch – part duex

Ok, so I decided we can make this program better and want to include more to the program.  There has been some discussion that the height should be a variable as well.  Also, I want you to include three constructors in your program.  One is the default constructor; one you will only pass in one value and all of the fields will get set to that value and the final one will have three arguments being passed in – one for each of the fields.  Finally, I want you to include a methods called toString().  The toString methods always a demo program to display an object.  It’s in the book.

Here’s what you will need for the Mulch class.

	Fields:  
	•	length
	•	width
	•	height

	Constructors:
	•	Mulch()
	•	Mulch(double)
	•	Mulch(double, double, double)

	Methods: 
	•	setLength(double)
	•	getLength() double
	•	setWidth(double)
	•	getWidth() double
	•	setLength(double)
	•	getLength() double
	•	getPerim() double
	•	getVol() double
	•	getNumBags() double
	•	toString() string

     Once you have completed writing your Mulch class, also write a program that will demo all of your methods to show that they work.  

Input and output should be done with Dialog and Message boxes. Your program should be well documented internally and externally.
